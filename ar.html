<h2 class="subtitle">Introduction:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a museum, many visitors have to search through a
booklet in order to find information about exhibits. However,
this searching method is very uncomfortable and tedious.
Furthermore, the information is insufficient to meet the
visitor�s interests. One way to solve this problem is to use
an enhanced experience technology, robots as museum guides. A robot which interacts with people
in the museum is a valuable application to explain exhibits, to
guide visitors, and to introduce additional information.
Interactive museum guide robots are able to automatically find
and instantaneously retrieve information about exhibits.</p>

<br>
<h2 class="subtitle">Proposal:</h2><br>
<p style="text-align:justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many mobile robots have been deployed in various
museums to interact with people naturally. The key requirements
of a museum tour guide robot are how well it interacts with
people and how well it localizes itself. Once those are
accomplished, the robot can successfully educate and entertain
people.<b> I would propose a museum tour guide robot for the AGHM museum visitors
which uses augmented reality (AR) technologies</b> to improve
human-robot interaction and a localization method to find out its
precise position and orientation. The AR museum tour guide
robot can augment such multimedia elements as virtual 3D
objects, movie clips, or sound clips to real artifacts in a museum.
This characteristic of the robot can be achieved by knowing its
whereabouts precisely, which is achieved by use of a hybrid
localization method. Many experimental results confirmed that the
robot can communicate with people effectively and localize
accurately in a complex museum environment.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Approach to Interact with a Robot using Augmented Reality:</h2><br>
<p style="text-align:justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are several approaches that allow visitors to interact
with a guide robot.Recently, many approaches have concentrated on objects
recognition and improvement of interaction by using various
methods.However, they only dealt with objects used to
retrieve additional information simply displayed on a tablet PC.
In order to communicate with individual visitors, Masahiro
Shiomi et al. used RFID tags. They performed exhibit guiding
by moving around several exhibits and explaining the
exhibits based on sensor information. This method is very
attractive to interact with each visitor. However, such methods
do not provide specific information to visitors. Felix Faber
suggested advanced tour guide robots by using speech, facial
expressions, gestures, and body language to interact with
people. From the point of view of improving interaction,
this is excellent research. However, even if the robot supports
visitor�s specific interests, there will be limitations in terms of
recognition rate, luminance, and pose.

To further improve interaction with visitors, a museum can use 
museum tour guide robot with AR technologies which displays
supplementary information on a monitor or projector screen.
The AR is known to enhance a user�s perception of and
interaction with the real world. In the museum, the visitors
cannot touch exhibits; thus, AR technologies can add more
information on real exhibits. In order to display additional
information onto a screen, system offers fast and robust
objects tracking, which is related to a markerless visual
tracking. Moreover, this approach needs to provide robust
navigation in order to interact with visitors and to accompany
with them during a touring crowded museum. There are
numerous obstacles, such as other visitors walking in different
directions, so using local sensors with a
laser sensor, which is called hybrid scheme. This 
system will be able to perform robust object tracking and robust
navigation in the museum in real time.</p>

<br>

<p style="text-align:justify">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the robot approaches any type of artifacts in the museum, it
augments multimedia elements such as 3D objects, movie clips
or sound clips to real artifacts. The most important problem
with the AR technologies is the registration between the real
and virtual world. To solve this problem, the augmented tour
guide robot requires a visual tracking method through the
robot�s camera which recognizes the current exhibit among
numerous exhibits and calculates a 6 DOF pose of it in real
time. This visual tracking method requires a training process
for real time requirement. The training process uses several
training images for a 3D object or one image for a 2D object
from a user and trains generic randomized trees using the
training images. </p>

<br>

<p style="text-align:justify">
<b>Navigation: </b><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the museum, there are crowds of people who are usually
moving to various exhibits. The tour guide robot must be able
to navigate in the dynamic and complex environment. Because
there are valuable exhibits in the museum, the robot needs to
localize its position and orientation very precisely. Also, to
combine the robot and the AR technique, the robot needs to
know its exact position and orientation so that the AR method
augments various multimedia elements to exhibits accurately.
To meet the needs listed above, an infrared-based
Local Positioning Sensor (LPS), an Laser Range Finder (LRF),
and wheel encoders are used. Information from these sensors are
effectively combined by using a hybrid scheme for robot
localization and a map building method. This method
combines topological and metric paradigmes to improve the
effectiveness of the LPS. </p>

<br>
<h2 class="subtitle">Conclusion:</h2><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"> So, to accomplish an enhanced experience to AGHM visitors using new advances in AR technolgy I would suggest having museum tour guide robot. </p>
